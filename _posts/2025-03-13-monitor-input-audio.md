I got myself an electric guitar and an amp for it six months ago. But I don't want to make a lot of noise, so I didn't bother with a combo and a head, I just turn on my headphones or more often I play on the built-in speakers. It's enough for me to play for fun.

What I lack is convenient monitoring in the system.
I don't know what it's like on Windows, but on Mac I have to: start up Ableton, select a device, switch inputs and monitoring.

It's a hassle every time.
As usual, all I could find was a piece of crap that is impossible to use.

I decided to ease my suffering and in 5 minutes Lovable wrote me a perfect web application: it just works and does exactly what I need.
