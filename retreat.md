## Recover your focus. Ship gently. Leave with an operating system.

AI made it easy to ship fast. It also made it easy to run your brain at 110% with no off-switch. This retreat is for AI-first builders who love momentum — and want it to be sustainable.

## What this is (and what it isn’t)

This is **recovery + gentle shipping**: you’ll reset your nervous system, rebuild clean focus, and still ship a *small* thing — deliberately, with guardrails.

Not a party weekend. Not a hardcore silent retreat. Not a “grind harder mastermind”.

---

## Format

**3 nights / 2 full days**  
- Day 0: arrival, settle, reset the pace  
- Day 1–2: two full days of structured recovery + shipping windows  
- Day 3: integration plan + goodbye

**Digital detox, but realistic:** screens are allowed only in **scheduled shipping windows**. Outside those windows: **no screens by default** (calm, not punishment).

---

## The core idea

High output breaks people mostly through **context chaos**, not “lack of willpower”.  
So we train two skills:
1) **Build consciously** (clear constraints, done-definitions, less tool hopping)  
2) **Pause on purpose** (micro-breaks, grounding, recovery rituals that actually stick)

---

## What you’ll do

- **Shipping windows:** 2 × 90 minutes per day (focused, low-noise)
- **One short “AI fasting” block daily:** build without AI for a bit — restore confidence and clarity
- **Nature immersion:** long walks (coast / forest routes)
- **Recovery practice menu:** breathwork basics, body scan, mobility, simple movement
- **Buddy review (support, not therapy):** guardrails, clarity, “don’t spiral”

---

## What you’ll leave with

- Your personal **Vibe-Coding Operating System**  
  (AI guardrails, batching rules, limits, reset triggers, notification boundaries)
- Restored ability to hold **60–90 minutes of deep focus** without jitter
- A shipped **tiny artifact** (demo / micro-tool / small feature / OSS snippet)
- A small network of builders who “get it” without backstory

---

## Who it’s for

- You build with AI daily (agents, copilots, LLM workflows)
- You’re shipping a lot — and you feel the mental cost
- You want recovery without losing ambition

## Who it’s not for

- You want a party trip
- You want a strict silent monastery
- You want a hustle culture mastermind

## FAQ

**Will I be forced to talk in groups?**  
No. Quiet is the default. Social is optional and structured.

**Can I still work a bit?**  
Yes — inside scheduled shipping windows. Outside: recovery mode.

**What should I bring?**  
Comfortable walking shoes, layers for evenings, a notebook. Laptop is optional.

**What exactly do I ship?**  
Something intentionally small. You’ll leave with a finished artifact, not a new obsession.
