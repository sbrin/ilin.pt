# Vibe-Coding Recovery Retreat (3 Nights)
## Calm your nervous system. Keep your edge.
**{{ page.date_range }} · {{ page.location_short }} · {{ page.language }} · {{ page.spots }} spots · {{ page.price }}**

[RSVP on Meetup]({{ page.meetup_url }})  
[Apply / Book]({{ page.apply_url }})

If you’ve been vibe-coding **10–12 hours a day**, you already know the pattern:  
high output, **wired baseline**. Focus fractures, your body stays tense (jaw/neck/shoulders), and “rest” doesn’t fully recharge.

This retreat is a **hard reset** for that mode - grounded, practical, and guided.  
You’ll arrive overstimulated and running on drive. You’ll leave with a **calmer baseline**, **deeper focus**, a **better sleep rhythm**, and a set of recovery tools you’ve practiced enough to use automatically during normal workdays.

## Why this isn’t “I can detox at home”
At home you negotiate with your habits all day. Here the **environment + schedule + group container** do the enforcement for you, so willpower isn’t the bottleneck.

Screens aren’t “forbidden”; they’re **bounded**:

- **Two Work Windows per day (optional):** 2x90 minutes (Wi-Fi on, laptop allowed)
- **One Admin Window per day:** 30 minutes (messages/logistics)
- **Outside those windows:** no screens by default (phone stays in a **phone hotel** you can access during windows)

This stops the constant micro-checking loop and gives your attention real room to recover.

## What you’ll do (and why it works)

### 1) Morning outdoor light (circadian anchor)
**What:** 5–10 minutes outdoors after waking (longer if cloudy).  
**Why:** stabilizes sleep-wake timing and daytime alertness.

### 2) Guided NSDR / Yoga Nidra (deep rest without sleeping)
**What:** 10–30 minutes lying down, guided protocol.  
**Why:** downshifts the nervous system and restores mental energy without nap grogginess.

### 3) Physiological sigh / cyclic sighing (fast stress downshift)
**What:** one deep inhale + a short “top-up” inhale + long exhale.  
**Why:** a simple on-demand “stop button” when you feel wired, anxious, or stuck.

### 4) Desk-tension release (grounding movement, not a workout)
**What:** daily guided sequences for jaw/neck/shoulders/hips/spine.  
**Why:** reduces the physical tension that keeps breathing shallow and attention brittle.

### 5) Break practice (micro-breaks you can actually use)
**What:** rehearse short resets (2–10 minutes): stand + walk, gentle mobility, breath, eyes-to-distance.  
**Why:** micro-breaks reduce fatigue and improve well-being, especially for knowledge work.

### 6) Sleep wind-down environment (simple, boring, effective)
**What:** dim evening light, reduce bright overheads, cool/dark sleep space.  
**Why:** removes the most common sleep disruptors.

**Optional:** caffeine timing  
**What:** try delaying caffeine ~90–120 minutes after waking (only if you want).  
**Why:** can reduce mid-day crashes for some people.

## Work with guardrails (no abstraction)
If you choose to use the Work Windows, we apply constraints that prevent the two classic traps:  
**infinite iteration** and **tool-hopping**.

You’ll be guided to:
- **Lock scope** for the day (one tiny objective, not “rewrite life”)
- **Freeze tools** (no new frameworks/agents mid-retreat)
- **Cap iterations** (stop after N loops -> reset -> decide)
- **Close the loop** at the end of each window (“what’s done, what’s next, then stop”)

This keeps the builder identity without letting the build consume your nervous system.

## FAQ (common fears)
**I’m introverted.**  
Quiet is the default. Social is structured and optional.

**I can’t be offline.**  
You’re not. You have an Admin Window + two Work Windows daily.

**I don’t do woo.**  
Same. This is practical: breath, deep rest, light, sleep environment, gentle movement.

**I just want to rest, not work.**  
Totally valid. Work windows are optional; the core is recovery.
